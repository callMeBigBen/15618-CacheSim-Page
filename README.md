## Summary:
We are going to implement a trace-driven multicore cache simulator supporting both snooping and directory based cache coherence protocols. We further want to perform workload analysis for program with different access patterns, locality, sharing, and the effect of different interconnect topologies on cache performance.

## Backgroud:
